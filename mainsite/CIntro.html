<br><Br>Hello guys!!!
 <br>
<p> Welcome to the CODEFREAK free interactive tutorial for C.</p>
<br><br>    
  <p> Programming languages are usually broadly classified into two major types, Structure oriented languages and Object oriented languages. </p>
<br>
<p>C is the most commonly used Structure oriented programming language. Even the compilers of some of the higher level languages were devised using C. 
With this tutorial,We are looking forward to try and to explain you with all the basics of C. </P>
<br>
<p>In order to successfully complete this tutorial, you won't need any prior knowledge of the C programming language. </p>
<br>
<p>To begin with, I will concentrate on the most basic concepts and take you up to the higher levels of C programming, including the usually intimidating 
concepts of structures, union, file, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, etc.</p>
