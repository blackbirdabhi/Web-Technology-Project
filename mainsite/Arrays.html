<br><br> <br> <br><m>What are arrays?</m><br><br>
<p> An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is 
created. After creation, its length is fixed. Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index.<span> Array index
numbering begins with 0.</span>The 9th element, for example, would therefore be accessed at index 8.
<br><br> <br> <br><m>Declaration of Array</m><br><br>
<p>Like declarations for variables of other types, an array declaration has two components: the array's type and the array's name. An array's type is written as 
type[], where type is the data type of the contained elements; the brackets are special 
symbols indicating that this variable holds an array. The size of the array is not part of 
its type (which is why the brackets are empty). An array's name can be anything you 
want, provided that it follows the rules and conventions. As with variables of other types, the declaration does not actually 
create an array; it simply tells the compiler that this variable will hold an array of the 
specified type.
<br> <br> <br>
<m>There are two ways to declare an array.</m>
<br> <br>
<m>Static:</m>
<li> int a[ ] = new int [10]; // In one step </li>
<span> OR </span>
<li> int a[ ]; // In two steps
<br> a = new int [10];</li>
<br> <br>
<m> Dynamic:</m>
<br>
int a[ ] = new int [n]
<br>
<p>For the above declaration, firstly <span>the value of n should be accepted from user and then the
above statement should be declared else it will give error.</span> </p>
